\section{Conclusion}

We present a new method and dataset which together improve melody transcription on broad music audio. 
Our method benefits from the rich representations learned by generative models pre-trained on broad audio. 
This suggests that further improvement in melody transcription may be possible without additional melody transcription data, i.e.,~by scaling up or otherwise improving the pre-training procedure. 
Through increased focus on melody transcription, the MIR community might reduce the gap between human perception and machine recognition of this fundamental aspect of Western music. 
By open sourcing our models, dataset, and evaluation, we hope to spark renewed interest in the MIR community for this challenging frontier.
