\section{Ethical considerations}

Our definition of melody transcription incorporates equal temperament, a Western-centric tuning system. 
This could lead to disparate treatment of non equal-tempered music, e.g.,~if a streaming service were to use melody transcriptions for recommendation. 
We therefore advocate for the deployment of transcription only in contexts where users are self selecting music to listen or play along to. 
Transcription may also be used to create training data for generation---as with any work on generation, there are risks of plagiarism and labor displacement. 
We recommend that any work on generation involve careful auditing and mitigation of plagiarism. 
Due to the incomplete nature of a melody, we argue that melody generation tools are more likely to be \emph{incorporated} into co-creation workflows (see~\cite{huang2020ai}) rather than being used to displace musicians.
