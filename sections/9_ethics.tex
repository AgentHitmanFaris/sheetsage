\section{Ethical considerations}

Our definition of melody transcription incorporates equal temperament, a Western-centric tuning system. 
This could lead to disparate treatment of non equal-tempered music, e.g.,~if recommender systems were to incorporate transcriptions.
%a streaming service were to use melody transcriptions for recommendations. 
We therefore advocate for the deployment of transcription only in contexts where users are self selecting music to listen or play along to. 
%, and that recommendation algorithms instead incorporate lower-level features such as \fnot. 
Additionally, transcription may be used to create training data for generation. 
As with any work on generation, there are risks of plagiarism and displacement of musicians. 
We recommend that any work on generation closely examine plagiarism within their system. 
Due to the incomplete nature of a melody, we argue that melody generation tools are more likely to be incorporated into a musician's workflow (see~\cite{huang2020ai} for examples) rather than displace them.
